        Mokhtar Dahari (13 November 1953 – 11 July 1991) was a legendary Malaysian footballer whose name is synonymous with greatness in Southeast Asian football.
        Known as <strong>"Supermokh"</strong> for his explosive speed and powerful strikes, he played as a forward for Selangor FA and the Malaysian national team from the early 1970s through the 1980s.

        He earned <strong>142 caps</strong> and scored <strong>125 goals</strong> for Malaysia, making him one of the highest international goal scorers in football history.
        His talent drew attention globally, and he famously turned down offers from European clubs like Real Madrid to stay and contribute to Malaysian football.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of his most memorable moments was scoring a stunning goal against England’s national B team in 1975, which remains iconic in Malaysian football history.
        He helped lead Selangor FA to multiple Malaysia Cup victories and brought pride to the country at a time when football was at its peak popularity in Malaysia.
      </p>

        Mokhtar passed away at just 37 due to muscular dystrophy, but his legacy lives on.
        His passion, humility, and national pride make him a role model to aspiring athletes across generations.
        In 2014, a stadium was named in his honor — <strong>Stadium Mokhtar Dahari</strong> — as a lasting tribute to his impact.
